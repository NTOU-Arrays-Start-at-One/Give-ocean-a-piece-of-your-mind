## Installation

+   To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository of this project by executing the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NTOU-Arrays-Start-at-One/Give-ocean-a-piece-of-your-mind.git
```

2.  Install the required packages by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary packages for this project.

Note: This project uses python version 3.8.10. If your python version is too different, there may be problems with the packages.

## Usage
+   Run main.py:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Notesüìî
+   Development environment: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
+   Windows users need to execute `python main.py` and replace all instances of `python3` in the code with `python`.

Example:
```python
subprocess.call([
                "python", colorization_path,
                "-i", source_path,
                "-m", weights_path,
                "-o", output_path,
                "--gpu", "-1",
            ]) 
```

## Research Methods
We employ the [WaterNet](https://github.com/tnwei/waternet) water color restoration model and [neural-colorization](https://github.com/zeruniverse/neural-colorization) automatic colorization model for underwater color restoration and black-and-white image colorization. Subsequently, we employ numerical methods to evaluate the image restoration results. Furthermore, we utilize [YOLO v8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for object recognition.

1.  WaterNet Water Color Restoration Model
WaterNet is a model based on convolutional neural networks designed to mitigate the impact of underwater light scattering.

2.  Neural-Colorization Automatic Colorization Model
Due to severe red light loss underwater, the automatic colorization model has the capability to generate any color in grayscale images. As a result, we apply it to underwater color restoration.

3.  Color Analysis
In order to compare results before and after image restoration, we incorporate colorboard photos into the shooting scenes to analyze and assess the effectiveness of restoration. We employ k-means and CIE-2000 for color block analysis.

4.  Object Recognition
Through YOLO v8 object detection, we can identify various objects, fish species, and colorboards.
